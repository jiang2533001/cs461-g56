\section{Current Situation}
From the problem statement document, we understand the purpose of this project and the general process for the project. From the requirements document, we start to narrow down the scope from the problem into requirements and we describe the project from attributes, functionalities and performance from a high-level. From technology review document, we break the requirements of project into small pieces. Each group member choose their three pieces and figure out the optimal choices. Now, we have finished the design document of the project. In this document, each group members introduce their technology part in more detail based on different viewpoints. After finishing this document, we get more clear visual for the project and we plan to figure out the specific step for implement each technology. After that, we would like to make a more specific milestone for each step to start implementing the prototype.
