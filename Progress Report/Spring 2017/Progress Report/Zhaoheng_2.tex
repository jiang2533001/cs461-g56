 	 \subsection{Steps For generating QuickSight Analysis}
 	The first step is to generate a data source based on the processed data. This step can be easily done by clicking the export button on DynamoDB console.  These data source are very important for Quicksight because the QuickSight requires these data source for creating data set and doing the analysis. Then, the Quicksight will create the data set by choose the data source on QuickSIght console. After the data set has been created, the visual can be generated by the data set. There are several types of visual on the Quicksight and we can choose one to generate the suitable graph for the analyzing results.
 \subsection{Screenshot For QuickSight Analysis}
 	The figure \ref{fig:3} shows proportion of different OS which users use to access.Based on the graph, most of users are using Mac OS or IOS to access the wireless.

 The figure \ref{fig:4} shows the relationship of total traffic in different connecting time and average usage in different Connecting Time. based on the graph, there are many users access to the server between 1pm to 4pm in 10/5/2016.

\noindent The figure \ref{fig:5} shows Proportion of Different connection model that users use to access the server. Based on the graph, most of users are using 802.11n (5GHZ).

 \subsection{Job And Things Left}
 	My Job is to design the data structure for organizing the table and the workflow for loading data into the DynamoDB. Besides, I am also responsible for creating rudimentary analysis on QuickSight.Most of my job are finished on last term. In this term, I update the workflow based on the suggestion from the client. Furthermore, I update the graph on QuickSight because some of the data in sample data are not filtered. My group plan to schedule an appointment with our client for checking the whole project.
