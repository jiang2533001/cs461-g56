\textbf{Positives} & \textbf{Deltas} & \textbf{Actions} \\ \hline

Met our client timely & Preparation for meeting was not substantial & Prepare questions in advance to thoroughly cover understanding \\ \hline

Completed problem statement & Organizational problems & Met with Dr. Winters to address problems and resubmitted \\ \hline

Completed first draft of requirements document & Unsure about functional requirements & Met with the client to discuss functional requirements. Resolved the issue with user stories and acceptance tests. \\ \hline

Our client thought the requirements document was good & Our TA did not approve of conversion from Google document to IEEE & Will start other documents in IEEE earlier \\ \hline

Finished the requirements document & Overwhelmed by planning in-depth technologies for the technology review & Met with the TA to look closer at these technologies and gain an understanding \\ \hline

Finished the technology review & Worried that our assumptions can be wrong when we actually see the data and begin implementation & Our TA recommended us to get some sample data to examine \\ \hline

Got the sample data from our client & Still is difficult to envision the prototype before implementation &  Examine the data types and how to implement \\ \hline

Finished the preliminary design document & Unsure how well the sample data we received from our client is representative of the actual data we will receive &  Meet with our client when we return from break to determine next steps to begin implementation \\ \hline
