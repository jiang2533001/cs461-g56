\section{Introduction}
OSU campuses generate data constantly from multiples sources. This quantity of data, also known as big data, can effectively represent student behaviors for information technology. David Barber, from Oregon State University Information Services, requested this project to unify the data onto the consistent cloud platform of Amazon Web Services, in order for queries and analysis to be performed. \\

\noindent Zhi Jiang, Isaac Chan, and Zhaoheng Wang took on this project and collaborated together to architect and develop a workflow, starting with data ingestion, processing, loading into a database, and finally to analysis and visualization. Our group did all of the development work, but constantly were in communication with our client for permissions regarding AWS and progress updates. \\
