\begin{abstract}
This report presents a thorough review of our 2017 capstone project. Included are previous documents: requirements, technology review, and design. Weekly blogs are also included to track our group progress by weekly basis. Finally, there is a copy of the poster that we presented at the Engineering Expo, project documentation, and personal statements from each member of our group. The purpose of this report is to coalesce all work over the year into a singular document.
