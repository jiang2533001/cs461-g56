\section{The Approach to Learn New Technology}
	\subsection{Useful Websites}
    \noindent As for this project, The first helpful website is the Amazon Web Services introduction page. From this website, we learned the general steps for big data analysis. Another helpful website we find is the Boto3 Document, Boto3 is the Python SDK for Amazon Web Services. In this project, we are using the file system s3 to store the sample data and the DynamoDB for storing the processed data. The QuickSight will be using for doing the analysis. In general, the project will start with parsing sample data from S3. After that, the sample data will be processed and store into the DynamoDB. When we start coding, we use Python to load sample data from S3 the data into DynamoDB. Therefore, the Boto3 website helps us figure out how to load the sample data from S3 into DynamoDB by Python. 
    
    \subsection{Helpful People}
    \noindent The first helpful people on campus is our client David. He helps us on writing document. He gives useful feedback to us. So we can revise the document based on these feedback. The data analyst is also helpful. She helps us about permission for using the tool on AWS. Finally, our instructors and TA are very helpful. If we have problem with our project, we will ask them for help.
