\subsection{Winter Term}
\subsubsection{Week 2}
\textbf{Zhi Jiang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
In this last week, we met with our TA on Wednesday and we talked something about our project. Actually, we have not yet got the account for Amazon Web Services, because our client explained that they cannot access to the cost and billing alters so they have to solve this problem before we gain account. As for myself, I read all documents we completed in this week because I want to review more details about our project.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
Obviously, the problem we encountered is the AWS account, we hope we can get it as soon as possible.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
We are planning to connect our client with the account. On the other hand, we should start to work on our project bases on the schedule we made before.\\

\noindent\textbf{Isaac T Chan}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
The week before last, we contacted our client for details regarding our AWS account access. We received a reply last week, explaining the difficulties our client is having with billing. We sent another email explaining the urgency and how we are behind schedule.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
We are now 2 weeks behind schedule and need to accelerate as soon as we get access to AWS and the data.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
Hopefully we receive AWS account access and will begin development as soon as we do.\\

\noindent\textbf{Zhaoheng Wang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
In this week, we schedule our group meeting with our TA and we talk about our current process of our project. Unfortunately, we don't get the AWS account access and the data from our client.As a result, some important step can not start yet. we have send an email with our client to check about this problem.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
we are waiting for client's email and personally i would like to do some research about this project.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
we don't get the account for AWS which is necessary for our project. Besides, i am still unsure for some of the detail for the project.\\

\subsubsection{Week 3}
\textbf{Zhi Jiang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
The good news for us is we get the access to AWS in this week, so which means we can start to work on our project formally. My task is to transform data from data storage to database in this project, so I read some developer guides for tools I probably use.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
I think the problem is I am not familiar with these tools. In my task, I will use a tool call “EMR”, and it is a little bit complex, so I think I should spend more time to understand it.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
I will start to work on my task in this weekend, and I will continue reading material for them. If I have any questions I will send email to TA or technical adviser of our client. Finally, I hope I can gain some progress before the next weekend.\\

\noindent\textbf{Isaac T Chan}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
We got access to AWS this week and have emailed our client for access to the specific tools we require. I reviewed the documents for a refresher for the tasks I'm assigned.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
I don't have any issues aside from delayed access to AWS. However, I find that most of my assigned tasks are after the majority of the work (alpha release will work without my contributions) so I want to work with my group on their tasks so I can keep up with the progress.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
I want to try loading sample data into the database. It seems that our knowledge about NoSQL tables is lacking and I think that trying to load the data in will help my overall understanding.\\

\noindent\textbf{Zhaoheng Wang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
In this week, we schedule an appointment with our client on Tuesday. After that, we get the access account for our project.On Wednesday, we meet our TA and we talk about the current progress for our project. On Thursday,we send the email for asking the permission for the software such as S3, Dynamodb and quicksight.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
Now, we don't have the problem yet seems we just have the permission for access the software.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
For next week, we would like to start our project as soon as possible. It seems our progress is behind the schedule.\\

\subsubsection{Week 4}
\textbf{Zhi Jiang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
In this week, the first thing is we have gained tools we need from our client. We started to discuss a specific plan for next step. And we will start to modify our design document because actually some tools and solutions are different from what we planned before.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
The problem for me is I cannot create a cluster successfully because we lack a tool called IAM. I have reported this issue to our client on Friday. I hope it can be solved as soon as possible, otherwise, we could not do next step.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
We will show some results for our TA in next week, Which is we will import data from S3 to Dynamo. This is the very important step in the whole project because all of the unprocessed files will be stored in S3.\\

\noindent\textbf{Isaac T Chan}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
This week we have obtained access to almost every AWS utility we will need. We tested some of them out and realized that our understanding of the utilities was flawed as we were writing the preliminary design documents. We have come up with a plan to tackle the rest of the project.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
No problems really, in fact this week we realized we aren't as far behind in the schedule as we thought so things are going well.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
Our group plans to have a working meeting next week. We will load some data into DynamoDB using a python script executed on an EMR or EC2 cluster, then demonstrate this to our TA. Additionally, I'm keeping note of the changes that I'll need to make to our design document before the end of the term.\\

\noindent\textbf{Zhaoheng Wang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
On this week, we have the group discussion on Wednesday and we discuss our project current process and the next step for our project. after that, we meet with our TA to talk about our project and the future plan. This week, we all access the AWS server in order to get familiar with our project and after trying some software, we find we might make some changes for our project.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
We need to do some preparation for loading data and we are catching up our schedule.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
For the following week, our group plan to load the data from S3 into the DynamoDB by using EMR. We plan to load some sample data into the DynamoDB. If the sample data works, the data we load in the future should be working. After that, we will show it with TA to get some feedback.\\

\subsubsection{Week 5}
\textbf{Zhi Jiang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
In this week, TA canceled the meeting, so we did not meet with her on Monday. Another thing is that I completed the wired assignment. I still introduced our project to my partner.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
There is no any problem so far.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
I will finish midterm progress report in next week.\\

\noindent\textbf{Isaac T Chan}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
This week we submitted our poster for printing after we got it client/instructor approved. I continued to work with the data analyst to connect to EMR and gained access. After gaining access, I ran the code provided, after making modifications for it to work within the AWS environment. None of this needed to be documented, as it was a proof of feasibility for our client's benefit and to ensure our project is finished.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
Haven't received usage estimates.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
I still haven't received an estimate for future usage so I can't complete the cost comparison. I'll plan on sending a follow-up email for those numbers if I don't receive them by Monday. I think next week the midterm progress report is due, so I'll do that next week.\\

\noindent\textbf{Zhaoheng Wang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
On this week, I introduce the project of my group with the classmate that instructor assigns for the WRIED card assignment. We have a short discussion with our projects. The project of him is about the mobile app which is designing for guiding the tourists. The users could easily access to map without internet connection on this app. It is very useful and it is cheap for the users. Besides, he also introduces the feature of this app. For example, there will be a website which is designing for uploading videos and feedback for the viewpoints. Another thing I do this week is to update the images for workflow and make it clearly.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
Currently, There is no any problem for me.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
For the next week, the midterm report will come soon. So I plan to start to writing the midterm report. Besides, I would like to introduce my project again with the partner who assigned for WRIED card assignment. Because I think some of the point I introduce is not very clear.

\subsubsection{Week 6}
\textbf{Zhi Jiang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
In this week, we have completed the midterm progress presentation and report. In presentation, we showed off our project at some alpha level functionalities such as importing data and visualization of data. On the other hand, we have revised some documents includes Requirement Document and Technology Review. Finally, we created OneNote and organized all materials and documents on OneNote.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
In this week, I did not encounter any problems.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
In this week, we have completed the midterm progress presentation and report. In presentation, we showed off our project at some alpha level functionalities such as importing data and visualization of data. On the other hand, we have revised some documents includes Requirement Document and Technology Review. Finally, we created OneNote and organized all materials and documents on OneNote.\\

\noindent\textbf{Isaac T Chan}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
This week, we scrambled to complete all the requirements for the midterm progress report. This included meeting to record our presentation, revising documents, and completing the OneNote. In the OneNote, we added an organizational scheme for our poster.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
Not really. Probably just need to talk to our client and data analyzer to be ready to implement my portions.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
During my review of my midterm progress, I realized that I hadn't done much personally regarding the project due to our task division. Actually there are still a few more weeks before I'm scheduled to begin my portions (have to begin after we have a working solution). But there's many requirements I need to work on my tasks, including getting data from our client and consulting with the data analyzer to see what kinds of analysis we should try.\\

\noindent\textbf{Zhaoheng Wang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
This week,we first revise our review document and the design document. After that,we finish our presentation slide on Monday night and we schedule a group appointment with each other on Tuesday in order to finish our presentation. Our video is around 20 mins. it is a little short in our project. As a result, we check it with TA on Wednesday.After that, we start our progress report on Wednesday night. After finishing the progress report, we need to make a simple structure of the poster.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
1. Check with data analysis whether there is an efficient way for organizing table 2. Figure out which sample data can be ignored

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
There still have some improvement for these parts in our project. Firstly, the way I choose for design the data structure may not be the optimal choice. Therefore, I would like to check with the data analyzer whether it is the efficient way or not. Secondly, the graph which made by QuickSight needs to improve because some of sample data needs to be filter. Furthermore, the QuickSight seems not handle the complex analysis and our client doesn’t give specific topic that we need to analysis. As a result, I would like to check with the data analyzer what kind of analysis we need to do\\

\subsubsection{Week 7}
\textbf{Zhi Jiang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
In this week, I started to improve my portion. On the other hand, we send design document to our client for signature, because we did some changes on it.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
We did not get the signature on time, so I just hope we can get it as soon as possible.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
In the next week, I think we should have an appointment with our client because we should report to our client what we did in several weeks ago specifically. I will continue to improve my portion and test it.\\

\noindent\textbf{Isaac T Chan}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
This week we sent our updated design document to our client for approval and signature.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
We haven't yet received a signature for the design document from our client and need to submit it by today.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
This coming week I need to contact our client and data analyzer for approval on the strategies I want to employ for data analysis and performance testing. This involves getting larger sets of sample data than we have received so far so there might be some issues regarding how much data they are willing to give us.\\

\noindent\textbf{Zhaoheng Wang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
On this week, we meet with our TA on Wednesday to talk about the current process of our project and we send our design document to our client for asking the signature.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
we don't get the signature for the new design document and we will send an email to TA. Hopefully, we could get the signature as soon as possible.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
For next week, we are planing to have an appointment with our client in order to check whether we are on the correct position. Besides, we might optimize our project. For example, the table can be optimized by creating three separate tables. By doing this way, some important data can be store more security.\\

\subsubsection{Week 8}
\textbf{Zhi Jiang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
First of all, I continued to improve my portion, but I did not complete it. Secondly, we got the signature from the client for the design document. On the other hand, we met with our data analyzer, and she gave us some suggestions about this project. On important thing is we should create three tables when we import data from S3 to dynamoDB.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
The problem I encountered is I did not complete function to create a table automatically. In this library, it has fixed format to create a table, so I was not able to use loop statement for setting name of each attribute.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
In next week, we will try our best to implement the solution based on data analyzer's suggestion. On the other hand, we still have a class meeting with our instructor, so probably we should discuss how to show our project in class.\\

\noindent\textbf{Isaac T Chan}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
This week we received our signed design document from our client. He included a suggestion to meet with the data analyzer, which we were already planning to do. After meeting with her on Wednesday, we got several suggestions about the pipeline from S3 to the database, and creating two other tables with identifiable data (MAC address, ONID) with a hashed unique key to tie them back to the main data. This is something we will implement with fake ONID and MAC address, due to the sensitivity of the data.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
No problems this week.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
The data analyzer gave us some suggestions that we plan to implement, including hashed user identifiers and also replicating data to check database performance. She will send us some code to test data analysis as well. Finally we have a class this week on Thursday, so our group should meet and prepare a little bit before presenting in that class.\\

\noindent\textbf{Zhaoheng Wang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
On the Tuesday night of this week, we get signature and the feedback about our design document from our client. On Wednesday, we have an appointment with our TA to discuss our current process. On Thursday, we schedule an appointment with the data analyzer and she gives several suggestion for our project. For example, we would have three table and two of them will be link table which contains Onid,MAC. She also mentions that we would use pipeline to export the data from database.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
Currently, we don't have the problem on this week.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
On the next week, since the group number of us is 56 we will have the on class group meeting on Thursday.

\subsubsection{Week 9}
\textbf{Zhi Jiang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
In this week, we learned some experiences about Expo in class on Thursday.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
No problems in this week.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
As for next week, we have a lot of things. We will go to test your program by real data. On the other hand, we need to complete the progress video and progress report, and finally, we have to finish the poster.\\

\noindent\textbf{Isaac T Chan}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
This week we met with the TA on Wednesday and discussed the deliverables for the coming week. Then we had class on Thursday and learned more about how to conduct ourselves during expo.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
Aside from requiring real data, nothing. Unless stressing about the million things due in this class counts as a problem.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
During our meeting with our TA we talked about the current state of the project and I realized that for us to use real data in the expo, even with hashing, we have to have at least one group member able to access to real data. I'll probably send an email to our client/data analyzer and see if we have to meet in person. We also have a meeting on Wednesday of next week to record the final report presentation.\\

\noindent\textbf{Zhaoheng Wang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
On the Tuesday night of this week, we change the table organization base on the suggestion from data analyzer after that we reload the sample data again. On Wednesday, we have an appointment with our TA to discuss our current process and the meeting on Thursday morning. On Thursday, we discuss our project with other group in class time.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
Currently, i have some question about the progress report which is due on the final week.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
on the next week, we schedule an appointment with group members on Wednesday 3pm to record the video for our project. After that, we are going to discuss the poster for our project since the poster is due on the Friday of week 10.

\subsubsection{Week 10}
\textbf{Zhi Jiang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
We met with our client in this week. We discussed his questions about midterm progress report, also he given us some suggestions for this project. We got a new workflow diagram; this is very important for us because we can improve functions of our project according to this diagram. On the other hand, we still completed the presentation for winter term progress.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
No problems in this week.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
As for the coming week, we would like complete winter term progress report as soon as possible.\\

\noindent\textbf{Isaac T Chan}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
This week, our group met to complete the recording of our presentation. Additionally, we had a meeting with our client to update him on our progress and get a signature for our week 6 progress report. We received a workflow diagram, which was their expectations for our progress. It aligned quite well with our solution, and we plan to update our design document with this workflow.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
There was some miscommunication between our client and us. He had thought that our midterm progress report was the final report, so some of the content didn't make sense with that assumption. We clarified this in our meeting.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
The next week I plan to complete my individual progress report.\\

\noindent\textbf{Zhaoheng Wang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
On monday, we send the midterm progress report to our client. On Wednesday, we schedule a group meeting from 3pm to 5pm in order to record the video for our project. On Thursday, I schedule an appointment with our instructor to discuss about the final report. After that, i start to write the final report and the poster on Thursday. The poster is due on Friday this week.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
Currently,we don't get the signature for our project. Hopefully, we could get it as soon as possible.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
For the coming week, i would like to revise my design document again because we get the suggestion from the data analyzer.
