\textbf{Zhi Jiang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
There is no any progress.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
There is no any problem.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
We need to complete our poster as soon as possible. We still need to do extra credits with other group.\\

\noindent\textbf{Isaac T Chan}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
No progress was made since the last week was Spring Break. I evaluated our position in the project to make sure I haven't forgotten anything.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
No problems this week.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
We have a poster due soon and should get some feedback on the drafts we turned in over winter term. Also, I need to send an email to the data analyst to obtain a script so we can ensure the usability of our implementation.\\

\noindent\textbf{Zhaoheng Wang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
On this week, i add a workflow for the design document base on the feedback which get from our client. After that, our group schedule a time for meeting with TA every week.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
Currently we have no problem for our project.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
For the next week, we will start to revise our poster since the poster is due very soon. Besides, we will also do some preparation for the Expo.

\subsubsection{Week 2}
\textbf{Zhi Jiang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
We met with our TA on Monday, and she gave us some guidance about what we should do in this term. On Friday, we still did extra credit with another group in Winters' office. We got some feedback and suggestion about poster and presentation.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
There is no any problem so far.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
As for next week, we will finish the draft of our poster based on feedback from Winters and another group. We will still send it to our client for feedback.\\

\noindent\textbf{Isaac T Chan}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
This week we met with our TA on Monday to talk about things we need to turn in, the current state of our project, and the plan for the rest of the term. Then, on Friday we had a meeting with Dr. Winters and another group to review our poster and practice presentations.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
Not really but we should be in better contact with our client this term. We'll send him our poster draft and see what he thinks.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
We received some feedback regarding our poster and will incorporate it over the weekend. We have another draft due on Monday, and will turn it in with our changes then. Additionally we'd like to send it to our client too see what he thinks. I also should send an email to the data analyst to obtain the rudimentary analysis script.\\

\noindent\textbf{Zhaoheng Wang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
On this week, we have the group meeting with TA on Monday to discuss the current process for our project. On Friday, we have the discussion for our poster and project with other group in order to get some feedback for our poster. After that, we will revise our poster as soon as possible because the second draft is due on next Monday.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
For the next week, we will finish revising our poster base on the feedback from other group. After that, we will send it to our instructor and our client in order to get more useful feedback. Once we get the feedback, we will change our poster. Besides, we might practice more for how to represent our project in expo.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
Currently we have no problem for our project but we are not sure whether the poster fits our client's requirements. Therefore, we will send it to our client and ask the feedback from him.

\subsubsection{Week 3}
\textbf{Zhi Jiang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
In this week, we talked about our current state with our TA and we also get a code used to test our project from the data analyst.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
we are waiting for feedback for our poster from the client.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
As for next week, we will go to test our project by using test code. On the other hand, if we get the feedback from the client, we still modify our poster again.\\

\noindent\textbf{Isaac T Chan}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
On Monday, we met with our TA to discuss coming deadlines and the current state of our project. We also sent an email to the data analyst to obtain code in order to test the usability of our implemented database. Additionally, we submitted our second poster draft and also sent a copy to our client. On Wednesday, we had class. Later in the week, we received the code from the data analyst.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
We haven't received poster feedback from our client for the second draft.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
The code we received from our data analyst will need to be ran on AWS. I plan on testing this next week. Additionally we will revise our poster, probably along with a meeting with our client. We need to clarify the deliverable "price model with locally hosted hardware" to make sure we meet the expectations of our client and professors, which we can do at our client meeting. Also, we need to remember to get written approval for using the "OSU Information Services" logo on our poster. Finally, I need to submit my model release form.\\

\noindent\textbf{Zhaoheng Wang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
On this week, we have the group meeting with TA on Monday to discuss the current process for our project.After that, we send an email for asking the testing code from our data analyst since she will provide the test code for our project.Besides, we send our poster to our client in order to get more feedback. On Wednesday, I personally schedule an appointment with Kirsten to ask some question about the poster and the midterm report requirement.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
Currently, we don't get the feedback from our client so we can not start to revise our poster.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
For the next week, we will revise our poster since it is due on May 1th. Besides, we might test our project on next week.

\subsubsection{Week 4}
\textbf{Zhi Jiang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
In this week, our TA checked the status of the project on Monday. The second thing is we got the feedback about our poster from the client. According to his feedback, we revised our poster and then we got the signature from him.

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
There is no any problem so far.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
We will go to finish our entire project as soon as possible. On the other hand, we need to do document assignments such as progress reports.\\

\noindent\textbf{Isaac T Chan}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
This week we received feedback for our poster from our client and revised it. Then we got a signature for both the use of the logo and approval for our poster. I worked with our client and data analyst to get access to EMR to prove feasibility and also to assess client expectations for a cost comparison.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
AWS permissions weren't granted so the proof of feasibility must wait until I can access EMR. Additionally I don't yet have an estimate for future usage, so for the cost comparison I have to wait until those numbers will be given to me before I can do that cost comparison. The comparison won't have any code involved, and will simply be a document. I'll put it in GitHub after the code freeze, as soon as those numbers are given to me.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
I wasn't able to get access to EMR and need to in the coming week, as well as prove feasibility by running a sample analysis script within EMR against our database. The proof of feasibility won't need to go in GitHub before the code freeze so we're fine on that account. I also know what I need to do for the cost comparison and will do that as soon as possible.\\

\noindent\textbf{Zhaoheng Wang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
On this Monday, our group schedule an appointment with our TA. Zhi Jiang and I go through the steps how to load data and create the visualization on QuickSight with our TA. We check out the first two requirements on the project. However, Issac is still working on the third part and he is not coming to the meeting. On Tuesday, our client email back the feedback for our poster. So we revise the poster based on the feedback and send back for asking a signature. On Wednesday, we get the signature for our poster.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
Currently, we get the permission from our client for the logo on the poster. Jiang Zhi and I have finished our parts but we are not sure whether Issac finishes his part or not.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
Since the Expo will come soon, personally I will do some practice for how to represent our project. Besides, most of my job are finished on the last term. Therefore, I would like to figure out whether my job can be optimized or not.\\

\subsubsection{Week 5}
\textbf{Zhi Jiang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
In this week, TA canceled the meeting, so we did not meet with her on Monday. Another thing is that I completed the wired assignment. I still introduced our project to my partner.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
There is no any problem so far.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
I will finish midterm progress report in next week.\\

\noindent\textbf{Isaac T Chan}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
This week we submitted our poster for printing after we got it client/instructor approved. I continued to work with the data analyst to connect to EMR and gained access. After gaining access, I ran the code provided, after making modifications for it to work within the AWS environment. None of this needed to be documented, as it was a proof of feasibility for our client's benefit and to ensure our project is finished.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
Haven't received usage estimates.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
I still haven't received an estimate for future usage so I can't complete the cost comparison. I'll plan on sending a follow-up email for those numbers if I don't receive them by Monday. I think next week the midterm progress report is due, so I'll do that next week.\\

\noindent\textbf{Zhaoheng Wang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
On this week, I introduce the project of my group with the classmate that instructor assigns for the WRIED card assignment. We have a short discussion with our projects. The project of him is about the mobile app which is designing for guiding the tourists. The users could easily access to map without internet connection on this app. It is very useful and it is cheap for the users. Besides, he also introduces the feature of this app. For example, there will be a website which is designing for uploading videos and feedback for the viewpoints. Another thing I do this week is to update the images for workflow and make it clearly.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
For the next week, the midterm report will come soon. So I plan to start to writing the midterm report. Besides, I would like to introduce my project again with the partner who assigned for WRIED card assignment. Because I think some of the point I introduce is not very clear.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
Currently, There is no any problem for me.\\

\subsubsection{Week 6}
\textbf{Zhi Jiang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
We went to complete the midterm progress in this week. Today we completed the video and then we planned to finish the midterm progress document on the weekend.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
There is no any problem so far.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
We will complete midterm progress document as soon as possible, and we will go to do expo!\\

\noindent\textbf{Isaac T Chan}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
This week we focused on our midterm progress report. We met Friday afternoon to record the video and will complete the document over the weekend. I also sent a follow-up email to our client for an estimation so I can complete the cost comparison requirement.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered}\\
Still haven't been able to start the cost comparison requirement.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
The coming week we will submit our progress report on Monday. The rest of the week will be preparation for Expo on Friday.\\

\noindent\textbf{Zhaoheng Wang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
In this week, we schedule an appointment with our TA to discuss current process for our project. We also ask some question about the midterm report and the midterm video. We are working on the slide for midterm report on Thursday and finished it on Friday. On Friday morning, I personally finish my midterm report and do some practice for the expo. Besides, our group are recording the midterm video on Friday afternoon.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
Currently, I finished my job which is designing the data structure for the DynamoDB and the workflow for loading new data. Besides, I finished the rudimentary analysis on QuickSight. However, I think it is better to check the current situation with our client and make sure our project are in the correct direction. Thus, our group plan to schedule an appointment with client.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
In next week, we plan to schedule an appointment with our client to talk about our project. We will check our project with the data analyst since the data analyst is the only user for our project. Besides, the expo is coming on Friday next week. Therefore, I would like to do more preparation for the expo.\\

\subsubsection{Week 7}
\textbf{Zhi Jiang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
On Monday, we completed midterm progress and sent them to instructors and TA. On Friday, we‘re done Expo well. We introduced our project to other people and answered their question in the Expo.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
I don't have any problems.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
I think in the week we will discuss our project with our client. We would like to know does he have any opinion on our work.\\

\noindent\textbf{Isaac T Chan}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
This week we submitted our midterm progress report and presented our poster at Expo.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
I have a final deliverable for our client - the cost analysis. I'll complete this next week. We might also meet with him and see if he'd like us to do any further work in the next couple weeks.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
No issues.\\

\noindent\textbf{Zhaoheng Wang}\\
\noindent\textit{Progress since last week:}\\
On this week, our group first submit our midterm report and the midterm video for the project. On Wednesday class, we get much information on how to prepare for the Expo on Friday. On Friday, our group attends in the Expo in KEC. Each of the group members introduces our general ideas of our project to the people and answer their questions. For example, one of them is interesting where are these big data analysis used for. I answer that these big data can be used to study the student behavior. For instance, we can analyze the average usage of the network and report the data. These data will help the network manager to figure out when is the best time to maintain the server.\\

\noindent\textit{Any problems encountered:}\\
Currently, I have finished my part and I have no question.\\

\noindent\textit{Plans for the coming week:}\\
On Expo, our group meets with our client and we have discussed our project.For the next week, our group will probably meet again with our client and check the requirements for the project.\\

\subsubsection{Week 8}
\textbf{Zhi Jiang}\\
In the fall term, I chose this project because I was interested in big data, but I did not understand it. Through these three terms, I have a preliminary understanding of big data and cloud computing, which is a pretty good experience for me. If I was to redo the project, I will tell myself that I should spend more time learning the knowledge involved in the project. When we did technology review document, I mentioned that we would use a tool called "Lambda," but when we were implementing the project, we did not use this tool. Thus this mistake was caused by my lack of knowledge of these tools.\\

\noindent Throughout the process, the skills I have learned are about the use of cloud computing services and the design of large data workflow. Also, I also learned to be more skilled in using GitHub and Latex. I did not intend to work on big data or cloud computing later, but the project made me aware of the importance of the data.\\

\noindent If I were the client for this project, I would be satisfied with the work, because I am well conscious of my efforts for this project. If this project were continued next year, I think a user interface should be a good choice for this project. The user interface can provide visualization of analysis results to students.\\

\noindent Expo is an excellent experience for me. I was very happy to explain to others what we have done. Throughout the process, I found myself not very good at introducing our projects in simple language. Not everyone knows the technology, so Expo teaches me how to give a clear account of those who know nothing about the technology.\\

\noindent\textbf{Isaac T Chan}\\
\noindent\textit{Retrospect:}\\
For me, this project did not have a focus on development and has been an exercise in writing and documentation, with occasional collaboration and scheduling. So a pretty standard software engineering experience. If I were to redo the project from fall term, I would spend more time on development in fall term, and less in winter. The project was structured in that there was initial requirements and design in fall term. However, without access to sample data and AWS, it was difficult to determine the exact structure of the project. When we started development in the winter, it quickly deviated from the design document and the technologies we said we would use. I've learned a lot about writing documents in LaTeX and making nice charts. I think that a lot of the documentation skills could be utilized in the future. Unfortunately, the overload of documentation necessary in this project has taught me a healthy distaste of documentation. I enjoy working within AWS but the scope of the project was not ideal for me. It was targeted at people with zero experience in AWS and was a bit trivial for me. However, our client was very happy with our final outcomes and found it to be a very nice proof of concept for future infrastructure at OSU. I think this project could easily be carried on for next year and be actually implemented into a workable pipeline, processing real data as it comes in. However, this might not be feasible as the data cannot be seen by students.\\

\noindent\textit{Expo Experience}\\
Expo was a marathon of finding different ways to describe something I have already described many times before. I found that our project did not generate a lot of interest with the majority of expo viewers. We never had to describe our project to children, or high schoolers. Instead, we did get some industry representatives. I was looking forward to being challenged by their questions, but found that most of them, once they understood the outcomes and processes, found it interesting and then left. I think that if we were able to implement our solution faster, and transfer it to the data analysts sooner to get actual results instead of hypothetical ones, we could potentially have generated more interest in the crowd and have us be more engaged in the expo.\\

\noindent\textbf{Zhaoheng Wang}\\
\noindent\textit{Redo the project}\\
If I can redo the project from Fall term, I would like to tell myself research more information about the project such as workflow and tools. Besides, I would also tell myself to ask more questions to understand the whole project. It is important to have some background knowledge for the whole project. Otherwise, it might cost much time to figure out. Take my project as an example, the project my group work on is to deal with the big data on the Amazon web service. At first, I have no idea about how to start the project. Therefore, I search online about the big data analysis. However, there are many ways to do that so it is hard to decide which is the best way for dealing with the big data. Besides, I am not familiar with Amazon web service. Thus, I can only guess the step before starting this project. Because of this, we spend a lot of time on asking the permission for using the tool.\\

\noindent\textit{Skill learned}
I think the most useful skill I learned will be how to solve a problem in the short time. I think it is very important skill for most of the computer science students. With the technology developing, there will be lots of problems in our daily life. Therefore, this skill become more and more important to us. Besides, another important skill I learned teamworking. I believe it is also important skill because most of project requires to work in a team. Thus, a good teamworking makes the work more efficient. I believe these two skills help me to work better in the future work.\\

\noindent\textit{Project like and dislike}\\
I think the whole project is very interesting. Currently, there are many places require the big data analysis. For example, there are more people shopping in Amazon on the festival. The Amazon company needs the big data analysis to figure out whether the server can work normally if there are many people shopping online in the same time. The part I don’t like will be researching part, there are many different tools can be used for the project and it is very hard to decide which one is the optimal choice. For example, we can use the Nosql or sql database as the storage way. However, the Nosql will be easy to load data but it is hard to search data. The sql database will be hard for loading the data but easily to search the data.\\

\noindent\textit{Teammates, if I am the client and if continued next year}\\
I think I am benefits a lot from working with the other two teammates. I believe the most important skill I learn from the teammates is how to work efficient.If I am the client, I think I will be satisfied with the work because the project fits all the requirements and each group members communicates with the client frequently.Currently, the data our project use simple data which doesn’t real ONID and MAC address. However, if the project were to be continued, the real data will be stored and the whole project will be applying into the real situation.\\

\noindent\textit{Expo experience}\\
The expo is very interesting to me. At first, I think there might be only few people come to talk about our project because this project is designing for the specific users such as companies. However, I find there are many people come to talk about this project. Sometimes, the people talk with our project ask some questions which is very useful. For example, I remember of the them ask me why we need to do the big data analysis. But some of them are asking very strange question. For instance, how to relate the big data with music tools. It is hard to answer that question. In a word, the Expo is very interesting and it is a way to demo our project which is very useful.
