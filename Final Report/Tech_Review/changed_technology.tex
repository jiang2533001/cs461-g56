\subsection{Technology Review Revision}
\noindent In our technology review document, we would like to some tools for ingestion and parsing of unprocessed data such as Apache Spark and Amazon Kinesis, but eventually, we did not use them. The reason is in fact; we are not required to complete ingestion and parsing of data. The client has provided existing data. Thus we do not need to consider how to ingest data by ourselves.\\

\noindent We change the language for implementing database table. Instead of using Java APIs, we are using the Python SDK for implementing DynamoDB table. The reason is Java APIs only show how to implement the DynamoDB table but they don't have the steps for loading data from S3 to DynamoDB. In boto3, We find the specific steps for loading data from S3 to DynamoDB through EC2 instances. Furthermore, it is better to use the same language for loading data and implementing DynamoDB table. Therefore, we decide to use the Python language to do the implementation.\\
