\subsection{Design Revision}
We changed Amazon Kinesis to AWS SDK. We found Amazon Kinesis is a useful tool for the data stream, but data our client provided is formatted. On the other hand, for some reasons, we were authorized completely to use AWS EMR, so we were not able to use some services. Python is a good choice for us because we are more familiar with it. The AWS provides a package of Python, and which includes many useful functions to complete our requirements such as downloading files from data storage or creating table into database.\\ 

\noindent On the other hand, we didnâ€™t use Data Pipeline. The reason we chose this tool is we would like to implement automation. The advantage of Data Pipeline is it can make a schedule for some specific tasks, so this point satisfies our needs. Eventually, we gave up this tool because when we used Python, we found it can also implement automation for the entire project.\\

\noindent We discuss the process with our data analyst for loading data and we find that a graph of the workflow will better represent the steps for loading new data. Because of this, we add the workflow for loading the new data from S3 into the DynamoDB.Furthermore, we also make some changes for implementing DynamoDB table. Instead of using Java APIs, we use the boto3 which is the Python SDK to implement the table in DynamoDB.The reason is the boto3 provides specific steps for loading data from S3 into DynamoDB by using EC2 instances.\\
